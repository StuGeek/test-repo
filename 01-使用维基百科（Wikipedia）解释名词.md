## (3)、 Software
### Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work.

## (4)、 Software engineering

## (5)、 Alan Turing
### Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

## (6)、 Moore's law
### Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.
